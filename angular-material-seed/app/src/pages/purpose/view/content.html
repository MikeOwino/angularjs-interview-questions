<h2 class="md-title">Why was this built?</h2>
<p class="md-subhead">
	This starter kit is greatly inspired and built upon the original starter app provided by <code>angular/material-start</code> located at <a href="https://github.com/angular/material-start" target="_blank">angular/material-start</a>.
</p>

<p class="md-subhead">
	The main purpose of building this starter kit was to provide a base for building and producing quick, material design interfaces with <strong>AngularJS</strong>. While there are various starter kits available, this one tries to mimick the original material design specification by Google closely, and more and more features will be added to it in terms of transitions, animations, components and more.
